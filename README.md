# Junk Food and Metabolic Health: A Data-Driven Investigation 🇺🇸🍔

This repository contains my final Master’s project for the Applied Data Analytics program at the University of Detroit Mercy.

## 📚 Project Summary
We investigate how junk food consumption affects early biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction — including insulin resistance, prediabetes, inflammation, and cholesterol risk — using nationally representative NHANES 2017–2018 data.

## 📂 Files Included
- 📄 `Final_Report_JunkFood_Health_Study.pdf` – Full project report, literature review, methods, results, and conclusions.
- 🎞 `Final_Presentation_JunkFood_Health.pptx` – Summary slides for presentation.
- 🐍 `NHANES_JunkFood_Analysis_Code.ipynb` – Python notebook with full code for data cleaning, modeling (OLS & Logistic Regression), and visualization.

## 🧠 Key Findings
- High sugar and sodium intake are strongly associated with insulin resistance, elevated CRP (inflammation), and prediabetic risk.
- Junk food intake impacts health **even without obesity**.
- Protein and complex carbs offer protective effects.
- Public health must prioritize **diet quality** over just calories.

## 🛠 Methodology
- NHANES dietary recall and lab data (2017–2018)
- Junk food tagging using keyword search
- Linear (OLS) and Logistic Regression models
- Significance tested via p-values (<0.05)

## 📈 Impact
> Metabolic damage from junk food starts invisibly — long before traditional health indicators like body weight show changes.
